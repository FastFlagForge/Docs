# Tsb
### fflag above but more complex
> [!NOTE]
> **"This flag makes you invincible against: **
- Tatsumaki's mid-air attack 1
- Tatsumaki's ultimate 4
- Metal Bat's ultimate 1

It also allows you to use evasive maneuvers against Suiryu's first move (try dashing constantly).

It might also work against Genos' ultimate 1, but this needs to be tested.**
