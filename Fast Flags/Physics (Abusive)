### No Animations ✨
> [!NOTE]

### Max Raycast Distance
> [!NOTE]
> **Raycasting is the use of intersection tests to solve problems in Roblox. The most common use of raycasting is to determine the first object intersected by a ray. This is done by casting a virtual ray from a certain point in a direction and determining the first surface it intersected with.**

> [!TIP]
> **Break legs collision from 2 to -inf, kinda break camera on values over 3 noclip cam on 3**

```
### Invisible 2 ✨
> [!NOTE]
> **Locks your character's position on the server to (0, 0, 0), having the side effect of turning you invisible. This only affects the server and other clients, not you. server-sided things that rely on your position, like clicking to get tools, will not function. In some games these can be abusable. Here is a list of them: [Link](assets/lists/experiences/specific.md)**
